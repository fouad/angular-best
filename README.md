# famous-angular

Easily add Famous components/containers in your existing angular app.

### container usage

Currently the recommended method is to register a container using `famous deploy` then
attaching the embed id as a param to the directive like:

```html
<fa-container id="de843059-f0a4-4c92-8bc8-01d1f35a81c6"></fa-container>
```

### component usage

TBD
